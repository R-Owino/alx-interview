## Minimum operations

The problem:

```
Find the minimum number of operations to generate 'n' characters in a file by using 'Copy all' and 'Paste' operations
```

- This is a classic problem often called "2 Keys Keyboard"
- An idea is to use [dynamic programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/) concept to keep track of the best way to generate each number from 1 to 'n'.
- Another idea is to approach it methodically, break the problem into smaller bits and solve each bit then put it all together.
