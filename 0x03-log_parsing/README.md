## Log Parsing

The problem:

```
- Write a python script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics:
- Input format: <IP Address> - [<date>] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" <status code> <file size> (if the format is not this one, the line must be skipped)
- After every 10 lines and/or a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C), print these statistics from the beginning:
	- Total file size: File size: <total size>
	- where <total size> is the sum of all previous <file size> (see input format above)
	- Number of lines by status code:
		* possible status code: 200, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405 and 500
		* if a status code doesn’t appear or is not an integer, don’t print anything for this status code
		* format: <status code>: <number>
		* status codes should be printed in ascending order
```

- Log parsing involves analyzing log files generated by software applications, servers, or devices to extract and understand specific information or patterns within those logs.
- Essentially, it is about converting log data into a common format to make them machine readable and can then be used for monitoring, diagnosing problems, enhancing security, and optimizing the performance of software systems and infrastructure.

The approach:
- Read stdin line by line
- Validate the input lines
- Accumulate statistics required
- Keep track of the total file size and count of each status code
- Print the stats after every 10 lines or when a keyboard interrupt occurs
